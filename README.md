# Employee Salary Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project revolves around conducting a comprehensive analysis of employee salaries within the organization, aimed at facilitating data-driven decision-making. The process involves establishing a well-organized database, populating it with relevant data, and leveraging SQL window functions for insightful exploration of salary distributions among employees. The analysis covers basic queries, statistical aggregations, count and sum window functions, along with advanced window functions, providing nuanced insights into employee compensation.

## Project Phases and Expected Outcomes

### 1. Database Creation and Data Insertion

In this phase, the focus is on designing and implementing a database structure aligned with project goals. SQL queries are executed to create the necessary database and tables, ensuring accurate representation of employee information during data population.

### 2. Basic Queries and Window Functions Exploration

The emphasis is on retrieving essential information through SQL queries, displaying all employee records. Window functions are then employed to calculate overall average salaries and department-wise averages, providing a foundational understanding of compensation distribution.

### 3. Creating a View and Analyzing Averages

This phase involves creating a view that encapsulates average salaries, collaborating with team members for validation. The view is extended to calculate average salaries for each department, enhancing the depth of analysis.

### 4. Statistical Aggregations and Window Functions

Statistical aggregations for all employees and within each department are performed using SQL queries. This ensures a robust examination of salary data, providing insights into the broader context and department-specific trends.

### 5. Count and Sum Window Functions

Window functions are utilized to count employees within each department and calculate the total salary for each department, as well as the overall total salary. This phase offers a comprehensive view of workforce distribution and overall compensation.

### 6. Advanced Window Functions

Advanced window functions, including calculations for maximum, minimum, and average salary within each department, are implemented. Additionally, queries are crafted to find the minimum salary in descending order within each department, further enhancing the granularity of the analysis.

### 7. Advanced Salary Analysis Queries: Understanding Employee Ranking and Distribution

This phase involves developing SQL queries to assign ranks based on overall salary, determining the rank of each employee within their department and overall ranking. Logic is established to manage cases where employees share the same salary, ensuring accurate rank assignment. The analysis extends to assigning row numbers, dense ranks, and regular ranks to each employee, providing a detailed understanding of employee ranking and distribution. Employee salaries are also divided into quartiles to identify salary ranges, contributing to a nuanced assessment.

## Documentation and Communication

Throughout the project, meticulous documentation of SQL scripts and queries is maintained for future reference. Effective communication with team members ensures alignment and understanding of project goals and outcomes.

## Project Impact

Upon completion, the project will deliver detailed and insightful analyses of employee salaries. Stakeholders will be empowered to make informed decisions about employee compensation, identify areas for improvement, and ensure the establishment of fair and competitive salary structures within the organization.
